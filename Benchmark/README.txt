Simple benchmark application
The user input a number 1-6 to choose a test program.
1-addition and substraction operations on integer numbers.
2-addition,substraction,multiplication,division on integer numbers.
3- same as 2 but the operation is chosen at random instead of beeing equally split.
4,5,6 are the same as 1,2,3 but on floating point numbers.
After selecting the test the user should not use their machine as it will severely impact the result.
When the test is done, some information will be displayed in the console regarding the minimum,maximum and average execution time.
The program runs on different numbers of threads.
After the test program is executed, a graph showing the execution time with different numbers of threads will be displayed, and the processor characteristics , test number and execution time will be inserted into a database.

FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS
implementing a proper UI
fixing the database insersion as it only works locally
