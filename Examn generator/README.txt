A simple application to generate a timed multiple choice exam. To use you need to have 2 files with questions. The files should be formated as follows:
1st row is the question
2nd row is the path for an image for the question(not optional as of now if you wish to use no image you should use the path to a white image here)
The following rows should be the possible answers to the question(Their number can be changed from the source code.The default is 3 answers for the 1st part and 4 for the 2nd)
An empty row.
The next question(and so on).
The app choses 15 questions at random from each file(this number can also be changed in the source code).
The path to the 2 files containg the questions  should also be set in the source code.
